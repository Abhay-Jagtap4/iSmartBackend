RF hand gesture sensor for monitoring of cigarette smoking
@
Today, over a billion people in the world are smokers. Smoking is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, emphysema, and various cancers, causing approximately 6 million premature deaths per year. Current methods of assessing smoking behavior (e.g., self-report, portable puff-topography instruments) do not permit the collection of accurate, non-reactive measures that capture real-time smoking frequency and comprehensive within-cigarette puff topography. Our goal is development of a noninvasive wearable sensor system (Personal Automatic Cigarette Tracker - PACT) that is completely transparent to the end user and does not require any conscience effort to achieve reliable monitoring of smoking behavior in free living individuals. A key component of PACT is a sensor that captures a characteristic hand-to-mouth gesture preceding cigarette smoke inhalations. This paper details design and validation of a wearable radio-frequency proximity sensor that measures the distance between an individual's wrist and chest in real-time. Hand-to-mouth gestures detected with this device provide quantitative data that can be used for analysis of behavioral patterns during smoking and other activities.

A review of early detection of cancers using breath analysis
@
Authentic and accurate information is basic to any disease control initiative. More than 70% of diseases are related to life-style factors such as food and beverage practices, personal habits, infections, tobacco consumption and social customs. In addition, urbanization, industrialization and increasing life-span are also known to influence the cancer pattern globally. This necessitates proper appreciation of risk factors and other causes of cancer by the people. Various modalities for early detection through screening are being investigated. Majority of the patients have locally advanced or disseminated disease at presentation and are not candidates for surgery. Chemotherapy applied as an adjunct with radiation improves survival and the quality of life. New anticancer drugs, which have emerged during the last decade, have shown an improved efficacy toxicity ratio. This review is more about the diagnosing cancer at an early stage using invasive electronic sensors and intelligent computing methods by capturing only the breath of the human being. Strengthening the methods for early diagnosis of cancers and improved treatments will have a significant impact on cutting death rates.

An mHealth Recommender for Smoking Cessation Using Case Based Reasoning
@
The possible cause of many life-threatening diseases such as lung cancer and cardiac myopathy lies in the addiction to tobacco. Apart from being responsible for premature deaths, early diseases and reduced immunity, smoking also inhibits physiological and psychological problems in children born from addicted mothers. Though many developed countries have consciously made efforts to curb smoking, for the developing countries, the trend is still on the rise. The promising factor is that there are many people who are willing to quit smoking and are resorting to technology and electronic media for the same. In this paper, we have proposed a unique smoking intervention plan with the help of mobile phones that uses a Case Based Recommender system. Our model resorts to generating finely customized motivational messages depending on the patient profile and delivery of the same via mobile phones.

Toward an mHealth Intervention for Smoking Cessation
@
The prevalence of tobacco dependence in the United States (US) remains alarming. Invariably, smoke-related health problems are the leading preventable causes of death in the US. Research has shown that a culturally tailored cessation counseling program can help reduce smoking and other tobacco usage. In this paper, we present a mobile health (mHealth) solution that leverages the Short Message Service (SMS) or text messaging feature of mobile devices to motivate behavior change among tobacco users. Our approach implements the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and a phase-based framework. We make contributions to improving previous mHealth intervention approaches by delivering personalized and evidence-based motivational SMS messages to participants. Our proposed solution implements machine learning algorithms that take the participant's demographic profile and previous smoking behavior into account. We discuss our preliminary evaluation of the system against a couple of pseudo-scenarios and our observation of the system's performance.

Proficient modus operandi for scrutinize air pollution using wireless sensor network
@
Air pollution is a critical environmental issue which is focused due materials such as Nitrogen dioxide, Carbon dioxide, Carbon monoxide, Methane, hydro carbons etc., heavy population and rapid increase in industries and vehicular transport development across the globe. This major problem should be identified, monitored and kept in control. It is also found that air pollution is the fifth cause for death in India after high blood pressure, heart diseases, poor nutrition and tobacco smoking, about 6, 20,000 deaths occur due to air pollution every year. According to World Health Organization International agency for cancer research has identified that air pollution causes carcinogenic, a major cause for lung cancer in humans. It also puts air pollution in same category as tobacco, UV rays etc. Urban air pollution causes 1.3 million deaths globally every year. A quarter of these deaths are due to lung cancer. The number of premature deaths has been increased six folds in these ten years. There are traditional air monitoring station available are quiet few and are very expensive. In paper we will discuss a dynamic and proficient method of scrutinize air pollution using wireless sensor network. The sensor materials monitors and controls the air quality system. The nodes are distributed in area of interest to measure air quality index, compared with standard value and the collected information are transmitted to the nearest base station and to the control room for air pollution. For power management requirements the processor can be made in sleep mode during idle conditions.

Prediction of lung nicotine concentration based on novel GA-ANFIS system approach
@
This paper presents novel GA-ANFIS expert system approach for the prediction of lung nicotine concentration by using "on inspect machine" recorded data. Smoking causes the majority of lung cancers — both in smokers and in people exposed to secondhand smoke. Total yields of cigarette smoke constituents are greatly influenced by smoking behavior. The size of particles in the smoke inhaled directly from a cigarette is controlled by ventilation and it has the largest influence on reducing tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide yields. Our goal is to get better results in prediction of ventilation as well as lung nicotine concentration for different type of cigarette data under the same smoking condition. The data, recorded for different type of cigarettes, are collected by special equipment in real conditions within cigarette factory. GA-ANFIS expert system performs optimization in two steps. In the first step, it generates eight different ANFIS structures, after which it makes second level of optimization using results from ANFIS structure and finally resulting in optimal fuzzy model structures. Validation of the novel GA-ANFIS expert system approach is performed in MATLAB environment by using data set that was not used in the fuzzy model training and testing.

The upregulation of Myb and Peg3 may mediate EGCG inhibition effect on mouse lung adenocarcinoma
@
The antioxidant activity of green tea polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been found to be critical in inhibiting carcinogenesis. In our previous study, we identified a set of protein coding genes and microRNAs whose expressions were significantly modulated in response to the EGCG treatment in tobacco carcinogen-induced lung adenocarcinoma in A/J mice. In this study, we further conducted some statistical analysis on our microarray data and employed The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma datasets as additional control. We postulated that if a gene mediates EGCG's cancer inhibition, its expression level change caused by EGCG should be opposite to what occurred in the carcinogenesis. With this assumption, we identified Myb and Peg3 as the primary genes involved in the cancer inhibitory activities of EGCG.

Radiation Dose Measurement by Electron Spin Resonance Studies of Tooth Enamel in Lime and Non-lime Consuming Individuals from the Silchar Region of Northeast India
@
Electron spin resonance (ESR) dosimetry of teeth is used extensively for dose estimation following exposure to radiation. The population inhabiting the northeast region of India is prone to different cancers of the head and neck, and their prevalence is several times the national average. The objective of this study was to determine the role of radiation in the causation of this high cancer incidence by performing ESR spectroscopic measurements of tooth samples collected from the general population living in and around the city of Silchar. Nineteen tooth samples were used, and the age of the patients was 13-60 years. The excess dose, determined by subtraction of the natural background dose from the dose absorbed by the enamel, was found to the extent of 123 ± 43 mGy. However, the individual excess dose was found to be higher in subjects who consumed lime (5/6) than in non-lime-consuming subjects (2/13). It is not entirely clear if radiation is the cause of this excess cancer in this region of India. Therefore there is a need for wider studies including consideration of tobacco consumption as well as a larger number of samples for tooth enamel dosimetry.

On the attribution of probabilities to the causes of disease
@
Leigh et al. (1996, Asbestos related lung cancer: apportionment of causation and damages to asbestos and tobacco smoke. Sourcebook of Asbestos Diseases, vol. 13, pp. 141–166) considered the problem of apportionment of causation to exposure to asbestos and to tobacco smoke in persons with asbestos-related lung cancer. The ultimate goal was to use these apportionments to determine the proportions of the total compensation for a lung cancer patient to be paid by the defendants responsible for asbestos and tobacco. The apportionment of causation amounted to a quantity being assigned as the ‘probability’ of causing the disease for each of the exposures, assuming that at least one of the exposures was implicated in the onset of disease. This causation probability for an exposure was the attributable fraction for that exposure as a proportion of the sum of the attributable fractions for all exposures. While the apportionment of causation in this way seemingly makes reasonable sense, it is nonetheless arbitrary and the apportionments have no natural interpretation as probabilities. Further, such apportionments are demonstrably incorrect, as we shall see. Intuitively, the causation probability for an exposure is its incidence rate as a proportion of the sum of the incidence rates for all exposures and in this paper we present a model which leads to causation probabilities precisely in this form.

Tobacco smoking induced lung cancer prediction by lc-micrornas secondary structure prediction and target comparison
@
Cancer is deadly, a genetic disorder in which invoke uncontrolled growth of living cells in a particular region. Cancer is usually invoked by many natural causes like exposure to UV rays, smoking tobacco, oil fogs, and exposure to radioactive frequencies. In this work, we concentrate on tobacco-induced lung cancer. There are many existing systems to detect lung cancer. But none are efficient enough to prevent it before it spreads. In this work, we propose an efficient tool to analyze the possibility of getting affected by Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) by comparing Lung Cancer microRNAs (LC-miRNAs) structures. Here we use global optimal alignment and TargetScan for target comparison and binding location detection. A previous research showed that major lung cancer genes are targeted by 8 type miRNAs. These 8 LC-miRNAs (let-7a-1, miR-7-1, miR-17, miR-21, miR-96, miR-125a-5p, miR-128b, and miR-145) were used for this analysis for accuracy in research. From this work, we concluded that use of computational techniques in miRNA and sequence analysis can reduce the cost of research and increase the accuracy.

Pathway-Centric Analysis of the TCGA - NSCLC Transcriptome Data Pertaining to Deceased Patients
@
Lung cancer among other cancer types is the most prevalent disease with about 1.9 million new cases observed each year and ranks the fifth most common cause of death according to the World Health Organization. Of the two main subtypes of lung cancer, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of all cases. The two major subtypes of NSCLC, lung squamous cell carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma are extensively sampled as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. In this study, we took a pathway centric focus on the analysis of RNA-Seq data belonging to dead NSCLC patients involved in TCGA. We applied statistical tests comparing subgroups of patients based on varying clinical traits such as tumor pathologic staging and the total number of days passed from diagnosis till death for the subjected patients. We also compared the transcriptome of smokers and nonsmokers to gain insights about the effect of tobacco smoking history on the gene expression patterns of deceased NSCLC patients. Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway was overrepresented in patients who died at pathologic T2 stage as well as in those lung cancer patients who survived less than a year. Down-regulation of the signaling pathways such as retrograde endocannabinoid, Hippo, AGE-RAGE in diabetic complications, Wnt, and oxytocin was also striking in patients who survived shorter. We show concordant results with previous findings about the down-regulation of nitric oxide synthase in smokers. This study may encourage more focused analyses of the TCGA data with a potential to cast new perspectives onto lung cancer research.

A Pattern Detection Technique of L-MYC for Lungs Cancer Oncogene in Bioinformatics Big Data
@
Lung cancer; also known as lung carcinoma, is one of the fatal diseases in the field of medical science. It is occurred due to unrestrained enlargement of the cells in the tissues of the lungs. This growth is expended outside the lungs due to the process of metastasis. There are different causes of lung cancer like tobacco smoking, Radon gas, Air pollution, Asbestos, and Genetics, etc. In this paper; the L-MYC genetics is under consideration that works as a Transcription Factor (TF) in the human body and controls the appearance of the multiple genes. Rearrangement or amplification in the L-MYC gene causes B-CELL leukemia and lung cancer. This paper deals with pattern detection of L-MYC oncogene by using Big data analytics techniques and to explore those motifs that are the major causes of lung cancer. Firstly, the verification and validation of the pattern detection technique is performed by the VDM-SL. After applying the formal methods; the corresponding implementation is done in the MEME suite and Motif Finder tool that is used in order to detect the oncogene motifs in bioinformatics.

A New TTZ Feature Extracting Algorithm to Decipher Tobacco Related Mutation Signature Genes for the Personalized Lung Adenocarcinoma Treatment
@
The big percentage of lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) arising in lifetime nonsmokers and the low sensitivities of known major tobacco biomarkers urgent the identification of real molecular signatures for corresponding personalized treatment. Moreover, cancer is presumed to have a symptomatology strongly dependent on modules of functionally-related genes rather than on a unique important gene. Our aims, therefore, are to identify signature genes by optimizing the tobacco exposure pattern (TEP) classification model and to uncover their interaction relationships at different molecular levels. A new method, TTZ, is proposed to extract features as input variables to TEP classification model. Based on the Z-curve method, TTZ is able to extract features not only from mutation frequencies but also from sequencing information of insertions and deletions. Two independent LUAD datasets, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Broad data, are downloaded to train and test the TEP classification model. Thirty-four genes are identified as tobacco related mutational signature genes with the accuracies of 93.55% and 92.65% for train and validation data, respectively. The inference of genetic and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks uncover that LAMA1, EGFR, KRAS and TNN are the most connected core genes. Six signature genes are proved significantly involved in the cilium damage pathway, which is considered as one of the root causes of lung cancer. The identified signature genes may serve as potential drug targets for the precision medicine of LUAD. Most importantly, the TTZ feature extracting method can be easily extended to other disease or cancer related mutational signature identification issues.

Computer Aided Differential Diagnosis System for Lung Tumor based on Transthoracic Ultrasound image processing and neural networks
@
Lung cancer (LC) was not common before the 1930s, but increased dramatically over the following decades as tobacco smoking increased, becoming one of the main causes of mortality due to neoplasia, both for men and women. The estimations made by recently published data found that lung cancer deaths will increase from 1.6 million in 2012 to 3 million in 2035. This is mainly because most cases are still diagnosed in advanced stages, leading to considerably low survival rates. Therefore, urgent strategies are necessary to facilitate early diagnosis or improve current diagnosis techniques. Due to late detection, only approximately 15% of the patients diagnosed with pulmonary cancer are able to survive for a longer period of time, however, the survival rate increases considerably if the cancer is detected in its early stages. In this paper we aim to develop a software application able to accurately and non-invasively aid physicians for lung tumors differential diagnosis and biopsy guidance based on ultrasound image processing and neural networks. This software application could be of real use for physicians to identify patients with LC and also could improve the percentages of early detection of lung cancer and the life expectancy of patients through lung cancer screening programs.

Survey on Lung Cancer Detection Techniques
@
The second leading cause for the exponential increase in the mortality rate globally is due to lung cancer. Over-consumption of tobacco and cigarette are the major reasons. Uncontrollable cell growth in lung region will affect the survival rate of humans. Manual interpretation of disease prediction might be challenging due to the exponential increase in medical reports. So, early detection of tumor from proper manifestation can be done through Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) techniques. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of different lung cancer detection techniques for predicting the nodule as benign or malicious.

Betel Nut Addiction Detection Using Machine Learning
@
Betel nut addiction has become a psychoactive addiction to hundreds and millions of people around the world. Among the four common hallucinatory addictions in the world, betel nut addiction is one of them after tobacco, alcohol, and caffeine. It is more acute in the countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Taiwan. This ancient habit is much harmful to the human body as it contains substances like arecoline, which is more similar to nicotine. Consuming it on a repetitive basis causes the deformation of dental structure and change in the oral mucosa. Also, people have a risk of facing several diseases such as oral cancer, neck, and head cancer, submucous fibrosis, etc. by consuming it. Unfortunately, in Bangladesh, rural women are more addicted to this harmful practice. The purpose of this research is to detect betel nut addiction so that its disadvantages can be spread among the people. In this paper, the machine learning algorithms detect whether a person is addicted or not addicted to betel nut. Nowadays, machine learning is the most popular tool for using algorithms that compute data and learn from it for decision making or prediction about something. Thus, machine learning approach was chosen. The methodology has required data, which was collected manually by analyzing some factors from previous research papers on betel nut addiction. The k-nearest neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree, logistic regression, random forest and Naive Bayes algorithm was used for classification and machine learning technique have been performed and evaluated them regarding performance matrices with a featured dataset. Among all the algorithms, random forest performs the best with the highest accuracy of about 99.0% with less training time.

Promoting Health Education through Social Advertising and Technology for Health Awareness Management
@
Health awareness and management is the global concern. Many promotional and awareness campaigns are run to uplift the awareness regarding the health issues. Social advertising solves the purpose of creating awareness among masses through highlighting the social cause through a strategically crafted message to generate a positive action among homogenous audience. These awareness messages are disseminated among the through the different media platforms such as such as print media, electronic, radio broadcast and now digital media which is the new form of communication. As a result, exposure to such communications is usually passive. These campaigns often face competition from influences such as pervasive advertising ads, strong social expectations, and addictive- or habit-driven behaviors. There are various health issues which are addressed by such public service advertising (e.g., use of tobacco, malnutrition, personal hygiene, alcohol, sex-related behaviors, drugs, heart disease risk factors, cancer screening and prevention, effects of smoking, road safety, child survival, and organ or blood donation). In our opinion mass media efforts can affect significant improvements in health-related behaviors or avert undesirable changes in large communities. This research paper will explore the awareness level generated from social advertising regarding the health issues among the youth below the age of 30 and subsequently will analyze various challenges involved to more strengthen these social messages. The study based on which data tabulation has been made through SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Scientists). To analyze the data through descriptive statistics such as percentage and mean to adequately verify information collected for this study.

Tobacco Smoking: Making Progress Against the Revealing Devastating Effects Using Machine Learning and Data Visualization
@
Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer that links to millions of premature losses of human capital around the world, which poses an ever-increasing risk to the human being. There are two challenges in Tobacco smoking analysis: lack of latest data and unrecorded influential factors resulting from poor accessibility of census data. This paper uses machine learning and data visualization methods to analyze the relationship between Tobacco smoking and lung cancer, aiming to make suggestions on improving the smoking phenomenon. Specifically, enriching the research dataset is required, the onset of research is filling the missing data and organizing the datasets from targeted surveys and governmental or institutional websites in the preparation stage. After that, logistic regression and KNN are two models to detect cancer associated with smoking characters and gene types to confirm the correction between cancer and tobacco smoking. Finally, this paper applies Apache Echarts, Microsoft Tableau, and Python Matplotlib to realize visualizations and bring three possible solutions based on the smoking problem: increasing tax of tobacco, prohibition of cigarette advertisement, and institutional assistance for quitting smoking. The experimental results show the disastrous effect of smoking in data analysis. Even though there was a decline in the global smoking rate in past years, smoking is still unabated becoming the second risk factor that emanates in numerous deaths. Based on that, the section of visualizations displays two applicable and effective policies that is proved by official website "Our World in Data" to restrain damages of smoking.

Applying CNN on Lung Images for Screening Initial Cancer Stages
@
Cancer is the most common disease nowadays, in particular the lung cancer is often diagnosed in many individuals. There are various factors that contribute to cancer in humans, but among them tobacco smoking remains as a key contributor. Smoking is a primary cause, but many other variables, such as second-hand smoke, industrial pollutants, asbestos exposure, and so on, can also cause cancer. These all need to be filtered by lungs, as lungs always need to be working, unlike other organs in the body lungs does not have any rest so it gets effected early than all other body organs, in such cases it has to be examined carefully and clearly for many times to conclude whether it is affected with cancer. This effort is made to make such simple support for doctors in designing a CAD system for identifying the presence of tumor in lungs, this model has high accuracy rate in identifying the problem. CNN is a reliable algorithm for finding such minute problems in CT Scan image of lung to confirm the disease. Lung CT images were used in this study. Training accuracy of our model is 96.11% and the validation accuracy is 97.8%.

Application of Machine Learning Ensemble Super Learner for analysis of the cytokines transported by high density lipoproteins (HDL) of smokers and nonsmokers
@
Smoking is a major cause of cardiac and pulmonary disease, cancer, and other inflammation related diseases. Smoking impairs lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. The observed modification and reduction in levels of HDL in smokers has adverse effects on atheroprotective properties. It has been hypothesized that HDL transports inflammatory cytokines which accelerate tobacco-related diseases. To investigate the role of HDL in the transport of inflammatory cytokines and their detrimental effects on the immune response, it is paramount to compare cytokine levels in HDL for Smoker versus Nonsmoker groups.We isolated HDL from plasma using selected affinity immunosorption of apolipoprotein A-I-bearing lipoproteins, followed by quantitative ELISA of cytokines.We implemented a powerful stacked ensemble Machine Learning algorithm, namely Super Learner (SL) with base-learners: Decision Tree classifier, AdaBoost classifier, Bagging classifier, Extra Tree classifier, Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier and meta learner: Logistic Regression. Prediction Accuracy metric was used to ascertain the separability efficacy of Smoker versus Nonsmoker based on cytokine levels. Super Learner composed of a Logistic Regression meta learner, achieved a 100% prediction accuracy, outperforming all the base learners.Machine learning-enabled Precision Medicine allows the investigation of the role of novel biomarkers such as HDL-transported cytokines which have a potential to generate valuable molecular insights. The discovery that cytokines are transported by HDL presents a new dimension in understanding inflammatory disorders and the potential for therapeutic intervention.The outstanding classification and prediction performance of Ensemble learning can be leveraged to revolutionize the biomarker discoveries, enabling insight that can lead to novel treatment modalities.

Contrast Enhancement based CNN model for Lung Cancer Classification and Prediction using Chest X-ray Images
@
Lung Cancer is one among the most perilous disease caused by various reasons with smoking being the common factor across the globe. Early detection is best for treating any type of cancer and this is very much true even with lung cancer. However, in Indian scenario, a patient approaching medical diagnosis at the early stage is quite rare. By the time first screening is done, cancer would have been grown to Grade 2 or higher level. Smoking and consuming tobacco products, as well as exposure to second-hand smoke are said to be major reason for this lung cancer. Classifying the given X-ray into cancerous and non-cancerous is challenging problem. Most of the literature’s reported so far have explored many deep neural network models for classifying the chest X-ray images in binary classification such as cancerous and non-cancerous. However, Chest X-rays are observed to have poor contrast in some cases, enhancing this contrast prior to training could be beneficial in terms of better accuracy of the model. Hence in this paper we present novel method of gamma corrected based CNN model for chest X-ray images classification. The proposed model has highest accuracy that is 0.92 and compared to other recently reported literature’s, our model is performing slightly better.
